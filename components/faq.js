      question: "Who can use the MTFX payment service?",
      answer: `Individuals and businesses who need to send money in
      foreign currency internationally can use MTFXâ€™s services.
      The beneficiary of the transfer must have a bank account
      for the funds to be paid into. Personal clients usually
      use our services to transfer money between their own
      accounts in two different countries. Business clients
      usually use our services to transfer funds to suppliers,
      fund international operations, or repatriate overseas
      earnings.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I use MTFX and not my own bank?",
      answer: `MTFX offers currency exchange rates that are 2-5% better
      than those offered by the banks. Personal clients usually
      save hundreds of dollars per transfer and for larger
      transfers, the savings can run into the thousands. We also
      offer excellent customer service, dedicated currency
      specialists, and a 24/7 online platform with best-in-className
      technology that allows you to complete transfers from any

      maintains bank accounts in all major currencies with
      highly-rated banks. Our banking infrastructure ensures
